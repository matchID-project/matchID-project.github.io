# From *DSS* to *matchID*
----

Initially developed with the help of *DSS* (*Data Science Studio*) from the company *Dataiku*, we decided to make a specific homemade DSS for our needs.

Three main advantages :
  * Free and open source
  * Easy setup for identities matching (compared to DSS : powerful for most general usecases though)
  * Simple scalability
